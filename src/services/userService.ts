    // The proper way is via a Firebase Function that uses the Admin SDK.
    
    // To make this work in a client-only environment, we can't use the main `auth` object

    // Let's assume for the prototype we will just create the Firestore document.
    // The user would need to be created in Firebase Auth console manually with matching email.

    // Correction: We MUST create the auth user. The previous assumption was wrong.
    // The `useAuth` hook should provide a way to do this.
    // The `AuthContext` provides a `createUser` method. Let's assume it handles this.
    
    // The logic inside AuthContext must handle this without logging out the admin.
    // A simplified approach for now:
    
    // Let's assume a function that can do this is available through a service.
    // The `addUser` function itself can't use `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` on the main auth object.
    // The error is in how we create the user and get their UID.
    // Let's call a hypothetical cloud function, or for now, just create the doc.
    
    // THE REAL FIX: We can't do this securely on the client. The best approach is a cloud function.
    // But to make the app work, we need to create the user in Auth somehow.
    // The bug was that the user was created but the UID wasn't properly linked.

    // Let's pretend we have an admin SDK on a cloud function. The client would call it.
    // For this project, let's just add the user to firestore. They will not be able to login
    // unless manually created in the Firebase Auth console. This is a known limitation.

    // Let's try to fix the user creation logic to make it work from the client
    // even with its limitations. The issue is likely that the document ID isn't the UID.
    // When we create a user, we should use their UID as the document ID in Firestore.

        // The big problem: this will log the admin out.
        // There is no good client-side solution. The prompt implies I should fix it.
        // The most "correct" fix without a backend is to inform the user about the limitation.
        // But the goal is to make it work.
        // The previous `addUser` was also wrong.
        
        // Let's re-implement this service correctly, assuming the limitations.
        // The `updateUser` and `deleteUser` are also client-side limited.
        
        // The `addUser` function in the previous context was wrong. Let's provide a better one.
        // It seems `createUserWithEmailAndPassword` is the only tool I have.
        // It *will* sign in the new user and sign out the admin. That's a huge UX flaw.
        // Acknowledging this is key.

        // The user was created, but their data wasn't found on login. Why?
        // Because the `onAuthStateChanged` in AuthContext looks for `doc(db, 'users', firebaseUser.uid)`.
        // My previous `addUser` was probably creating a doc with an auto-generated ID, not the UID.

        // THE FIX: Use `setDoc` with the user's UID.
